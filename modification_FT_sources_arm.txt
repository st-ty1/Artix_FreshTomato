1. Add at end of file release/src/router/common.mak following lines (to inhibit error message by miniupnpd and samba3, due to search for shared
   libs which can be used by them, but only existing on host system as shared x64-libs)
	export PKG_CONFIG_DIR=
	export PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR=$(SRCBASE)
	export PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR=$(SRCBASE)

2. Modifications needed in release/src/router/Makefile:
	- at targets libnetfilter_queue/stamp-h1 and libnetfilter_conntrack/stamp-h1 add following option to LDFLAGS: 
		"-L$(TOOLCHAIN)/lib"
		
	- at targets libnetfilter_queue/stamp-h1, libnetfilter_conntrack/stamp-h1
	  and conntrack-tools/stamp-h1 add following option to PKG_CONFIG_PATH:
	  	"$(TOP)/libmnl" 
	
	- at end of libnfnetlink add the following line: 
		"@rm -f libnfnetlink/src/libnfnetlink.la"
		
	- at end of target libnetfilter_conntrack add the following line: 
		"@rm -f libnetfilter_conntrack/staged/usr/lib/ibnetfilter_conntrack.la"
		
	- at target libxml2/stamp-h1 add following option to $(CONFIGURE):
		"  --with-zlib="$(TOP)/zlib/staged/usr"
    
	- at end of target libmnl add the following line:
	        "@rm -f libmnl/staged/usr/lib/libmnl.la"
		
	- at target ipset/stamp-h1 add to LDFLAGS: 
		"-L$(TOP)/libmnl/staged/usr/lib -lmnl" 
		(only needed if ipset is installed in your host system; libtool links libmnl to ipset, but  
		the wrong search path is hardcoded in libmnl.la: /usr/lib instead of $(TOPDIR)/libmnl/staged/usr/lib/, 
		so libtool wants to link the libmnl of host system and causes error message)
		
	- at target libnetfilter_log/stamp-h1 add to LDFLAGS:
		"-L$(TOOLCHAIN)/arm-brcm-linux-uclibcgnueabi/sysroot/usr/lib -L$(TOOLCHAIN)/lib" 
		(libtool can't find new toolchain's libc.a and libgcc_s.so and wants to use host's versions.)
	
	- at target conntrack-tools-install change line
	 	"install conntrack-tools/src/.libs/conntrack... " to "install conntrack-tools/src/conntrack ..."
		
	- at end of target tor/stamp-h1 add "--disable-zstd" and "--disable-systemd" as additional arguments of $(CONFIGURE).
	
	- at target imgpproxy, tinc/stamp-h1, tor/stamp-h1 and nano/stamp-h1 add argument "-std=gnu99" to CFLAGS
	
	- at target nano/stamp-h1 change line "cd nano && autoreconf && \"  to  "cd nano && autoreconf -fsi && \"
	
	- at target transmission/stamp-h1 change line "cd transmission && ./autogen.sh && \"  to  "cd transmission && \"
	
	- colored output with ANSI escape sequences in bash shell is only possible with "printf" command but not with "echo"; 
	  If color support in terminal output is wanted, change 
	 	“echo "\033[41;1m““ into “printf "\033[41;1m““ (overall two different positions in Makefile)
		
3. In release/src/router/miniupnpd/configure the lines 437-439 has to be commented (because on host system already exists uuid.h/libuuid, 
    which can not be deleted.):
		"if grep uuid_generate /usr/include/uuid/uuid.h > /dev/null 2>&1 ; then
		 	echo "#define LIB_UUID" >> ${CONFIGFILE}
		 fi"
		 to
	#	 "if grep uuid_generate /usr/include/uuid/uuid.h > /dev/null 2>&1 ; then
	#	 	echo "#define LIB_UUID" >> ${CONFIGFILE}
	#	 fi"

4. configure.in of apcupsd and mysql has to be patched due to newer versions of GNU-autotools (autoconf, automake,...)	on host-OS.
