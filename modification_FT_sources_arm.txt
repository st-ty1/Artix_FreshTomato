1. Add at end of file release/src/router/common.mak following lines (to inhibit error message, e.g. by iptables-1.6.x or by samba3, due to shared
   libraries needed by the FT-progs but already existing on host system as shared x64-libs)
	export PKG_CONFIG_DIR=
	export PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR=$(SRCBASE)
	export PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR=$(SRCBASE)

2. in file release/src/router/tor/configure.ac two of the search routines for systemd and libzstd has to be commented out (due to more aggressive search to them in
   newer versions of tor and that theses searches will errornously find the host-versions of systemd and libzstd and will lead to build breaks.)
	
3. in file release/src/router/miniupnpd/genconfig.sh following 3 lines has to be commented out (due to uuid.h/libuuid already exists on host system, 
   but cannot be uninstalled on host system)	
		"if grep uuid_generate /usr/include/uuid/uuid.h > /dev/null 2>&1 ; then
		 	 echo "#define LIB_UUID" >> ${CONFIGFILE}
		 fi"

4. Modifications needed in release/src/router/Makefile:
	- at target portmap/stamp-h1 change
			"cd portmap \
		 	 $(MAKE) -C portmap ... "
		into
			"cd portmap"

        - at target sd-idle delete following line:
		"cd sd-idle && \"

	- only arm, not needed arm7 or arm-ng: at targets libnetfilter_log/stamp-h1 , libnetfilter_queue/stamp-h1 and
	  libnetfilter_conntrack/stamp-h1 add following option to LDFLAGS: 
		"-L$(TOOLCHAIN)/lib"
		
	- only arm, not needed for arm7/arm-ng: at targets libnetfilter_queue/stamp-h1, libnetfilter_conntrack/stamp-h1
	  and conntrack-tools/stamp-h1 add following option to PKG_CONFIG_PATH:
	  	"$(TOP)/libmnl" 
	
	- not needed for arm7/arm-ng: at end of libnfnetlink add the following line: 
		"@rm -f libnfnetlink/src/libnfnetlink.la"
		
	- not needed for arm7/arm-ng: at end of target libnetfilter_conntrack add the following line: 
		"@rm -f libnetfilter_conntrack/staged/usr/lib/ibnetfilter_conntrack.la"
		
	- at target libxml2/stamp-h1 add following option to $(CONFIGURE):
		"  --with-zlib="$(TOP)/zlib/staged/usr"
    
	- at end of target libmnl add the following line:
	        "@rm -f libmnl/staged/usr/lib/libmnl.la"
		
	- at target getdns/build/Makefile add these two additional -D arguments to the cmake command:
 		  -DSTRPTIME_WORKS_EXITCODE="PLEASE_FILL_OUT-FAILED_TO_RUN" \
		  -DSTRPTIME_WORKS_EXITCODE__TRYRUN_OUTPUT="PLEASE_FILL_OUT-NOTFOUND" -Hforce \

	- at target ipset/stamp-h1 add to LDFLAGS: 
		"-L$(TOP)/libmnl/staged/usr/lib -lmnl" 
		(only needed if ipset is installed in your host system; libtool links libmnl to ipset, but  
		the wrong search path is hardcoded in libmnl.la: /usr/lib instead of $(TOPDIR)/libmnl/staged/usr/lib/, 
		so libtool wants to link the libmnl of host system and causes error message)
		
	- not needed for arm-ng: at target flac/stamp-h1 add to LDFLAGS:
		"-L$(TOOLCHAIN)/arm-brcm-linux-uclibcgnueabi/sysroot/usr/lib -L$(TOOLCHAIN)/lib" 
		(libtool can't find new toolchain's libc.a and libgcc_s.so and wants to use host's versions.)
	
	- colored output with ANSI escape sequences in bash shell is only possible with "printf" command but not with "echo"; 
	  If color support in terminal output is wanted, change 
	 	“echo "\033[41;1m““ into “printf "\033[41;1m““ (overall two different positions in Makefile)
		
5. Delete file desdata.stamp in folder /release/src/router/nettle (as it crashes building process!)
