1. Modifications needed in release/src/router/Makefile:
	- at targets libnetfilter_queue/stamp-h1 and libnetfilter_conntrack/stamp-h1 add following option to LDFLAGS: 
		"-L$(TOOLCHAIN)/lib"
		
	- at end of target libnfnetlink add the following line: 
		"@rm -f libnfnetlink/src/libnfnetlink.la"
		
	- at end of taget libpng add the following line: 
		"@rm -f $(TOP)/libpng/staged/usr/lib/libpng.la
		 @rm -f $(TOP)/libpng/staged/usr/lib/libpng12.la"
		
	- at end of target libnetfilter_conntrack add the following line: 
		"@rm -f libnetfilter_conntrack/staged/usr/lib/ibnetfilter_conntrack.la"
		
	- at target libxml2/stamp-h1 add following option to $(CONFIGURE):
		"  --with-zlib="$(TOP)/zlib/staged/usr"
    
	- at end of target libmnl add the following line:
	        "@rm -f libmnl/staged/usr/lib/libmnl.la"
		
	- at target ipset/stamp-h1 add to LDFLAGS: 
		"-L$(TOP)/libmnl/staged/usr/lib -lmnl" 
		(only needed if ipset is installed in your host system; libtool links libmnl to ipset, but  
		the wrong search path is hardcoded in libmnl.la: /usr/lib instead of $(TOPDIR)/libmnl/staged/usr/lib/, 
		so libtool wants to link the libmnl of host system and causes error message)
		
	- at target libnetfilter_log/stamp-h1 add to LDFLAGS:
		"-L$(TOOLCHAIN)/arm-brcm-linux-uclibcgnueabi/sysroot/usr/lib -L$(TOOLCHAIN)/lib" 
		(libtool can't find new toolchain's libc.a and libgcc_s.so and wants to use host's versions.)
	
	- at target conntrack-tools-install change line
	 	"install conntrack-tools/src/.libs/conntrack ... " to "install conntrack-tools/src/conntrack ..."
		
	- at target transmission/stamp-h1 change line "cd transmission && ./autogen.sh && \"  to  "cd transmission && \"
		
2. In release/src/router/miniupnpd/configure the lines 437-439 has to be commented (because on host system already exists uuid.h/libuuid, 
    which can not be deleted):
		"if grep uuid_generate /usr/include/uuid/uuid.h > /dev/null 2>&1 ; then
		 	echo "#define LIB_UUID" >> ${CONFIGFILE}
		 fi"
		 to
	#	 "if grep uuid_generate /usr/include/uuid/uuid.h > /dev/null 2>&1 ; then
	#	 	echo "#define LIB_UUID" >> ${CONFIGFILE}
	#	 fi"

3. configure.in of apcupsd has to be patched due to newer versions of GNU-autotools (autoconf, automake,...) on host-OS. 

4. configure.ac of transmission has to be patched because of break by intltoolize.
