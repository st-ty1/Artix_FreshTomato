Actually, do not use the building procedure for arm/arm7/arm-ng:
- Makefile patches for arm arm7 missing a patch for flac due to new toolchain, and 
   Makefile patch for arm is missing supprt for conntrack-tools.
As arm-ng branch has no new toolcahin support there is a need for creation of an separate Makefile.patch for arm-ng.

I'm working on it.
