Here, two versions of building the mips-toolchain with gcc-4.2.4 and uClibc-0.9.30 are provided:
One is based on buildroot software, the other is using the openwrt-based source code encloses in FT-sources.
There exists some other ways to build this mips-toolchain:
  - A more updated, openwrt-based version, available under https://github.com/wl500g/toolchain (But still needs some of the patches listed here.)
  - by crosstools-ng (some of the patches listed have to be inserted).
