mipsel-uClibc-toolchain with buildroot vers. 2011.02 (tested only on Artix/Arch Linux; not tested on Debian/Ubuntu, but should also work).

Shell script build_ft-mips-2011.02_RT-AC.sh shows a way, how to integrate this mips-toolchain into the sources of FT (for use with sources of asuswrt-Merlin/John's fork the paths in the script have to be amended respectively), as some patches are also needed.
