1. Applied changes in .config (and config. old), located in root folder of buildroot:
1.a due to "locale" failure while building uclibc, BR2_TOOLCHAIN_BUILDROOT_LOCALE, BR2_ENABLE_LOCALES and BR2_EXTRA_GCC_CONFIG_OPTIONS are changed to:
	# BR2_TOOLCHAIN_BUILDROOT_LOCALE is not set
	BR2_EXTRA_GCC_CONFIG_OPTIONS="--disable-nls"
    	
1.b Download mirror of kernel is not available anymore, so BR2_KERNEL_MIRROR is changed: (rem.: not relevant anymore)
	BR2_KERNEL_MIRROR="https://www.linux-mips.org/pub/linux/mips/kernel/v2.6"
 
1.c gcc in freshtomato uses ssp-lib, so BR2_TOOLCHAIN_BUILDROOT_USE_SSP is set to yes:
	BR2_TOOLCHAIN_BUILDROOT_USE_SSP=y 

1.d There is no need for the toolchain to compile some uncessary packages , so 
        BR2_PACKAGE_ZLIB, BR2_PACKAGE_LIBGCRYPT, BR2_PACKAGE_LIBGPG_ERROR and BR2_PACKAGE_OPENSSL 
	were changed from "=y" to "is not set" und and commented out by "#".

1.e As in original toolchain of FT the option "config_soft_float" is set to "no", BR2_SOFT_FLOAT is also not set:
       # BR2_SOFT_FLOAT is not set

2. Applied changes in file packages/Makefile.in: 
     "unknown" is removed out of the target-triple, i.e. 
   "REAL_GNU_TARGET_NAME=$(ARCH)-unknown-linux-$(LIBC)$(ABI)" was changed into 
   "REAL_GNU_TARGET_NAME=$(ARCH)-linux-$(LIBC)$(ABI)"

3. Applied changes in toolchain/uClibc/uClibc-0.9.30.config
    The following paths were changed in this modded uClibc-0.9.30.config: 
	KERNEL_HEADERS="./toolchain_build_mips/linux/include"	to 	KERNEL_HEADERS="/usr/src/linux/include"
   	DEVEL_PREFIX	to 	DEVEL_PREFIX="/usr/"
	RUNTIME_PREFIX	to	RUNTIME_PREFIX="/"
	and SHARED_LIB_LOADER_PREFIX	  to	  SHARED_LIB_LOADER_PREFIX="/lib"

4. Applied changes to toolchain/gcc/gcc-uclibc-4.x.mk:
4.a gmp and mpfr can not be used by gcc-4.2.4. So to save time, following lines (line 110-115 and 125) were commented out:
	$(GCC_WITH_HOST_GMP), $(GCC_WITH_HOST_MPFR) 
	GCC_WITH_HOST_GMP = --with-gmp=$(HOST_DIR)/usr
	GCC_WITH_HOST_MPFR = --with-mpfr=$(HOST_DIR)/usr
	ifeq ($(BR2_TOOLCHAIN_BUILDROOT),y)
		HOST_SOURCE += host-gmp-source host-mpfr-source
	endif
	GCC_HOST_PREREQ = host-gmp host-mpfr
	...
	GCC_TARGET_PREREQ += mpfr gmp

4.b texinfo/gettext makes trouble during build process of gcc. The unneeded documentation was switched off by additional option of configure:
		MAKEINFO=missing
    (integrated in all of 3 building stages of gcc)

4.c  All C- and C++-options of gcc of FT-toolchain (but without -fhonour-copts!, -> error:  "unknown option") are inserted as options in "make" command in all of the 3 stages of gcc (gcc-4.2.4-initial, gcc-4.2.4-intermediate und gcc-4.2.4-final): 
	CFLAGS_FOR_TARGET="-Os -std=gnu89 -fgnu89-inline -pipe -mips32 -mtune=mips32 -funit-at-a-time" \
	CXXFLAGS_FOR_TARGET="-Os -pipe -mips32 -mtune=mips32 -funit-at-a-time" 
 	
4.d gcc of original FT-toolchain uses tls, so the additional configure option "--enable-tls" was commented out to all of 3 building stages of gcc .		

5. Applied changes in toolchain/uClibc/uclibc.mk:
   Following  C- und C++-flags of FT-toolchain were integrated as "CPU-FLAGS"-options in nearly all "make" commands:
 	- for make-targets "install_headers": 
	  CPU_CFLAGS="-Os -pipe -mips32 -mtune=mips32 -funit-at-a-time" 
	- for make-targets "all", "install_runtime", "install_dev", "hostutils", "install_runtime", "utils" and install_utils":
	   CPU_CFLAGS="-funsigned-char -fno-builtin -fno-asm --std=gnu99 -ffunction-sections -fdata-sections -Os -pipe -mips32 -mtune=mips32 -funit-at-a-time"
        
6. As the kernel sources are only available as .gz package, in toolchain/kernel-headers/kernel-headers.mk, LINUX_HEADERS_SOURCE and LINUX_HEADERS_CAT were changed to:
	LINUX_HEADERS_SOURCE:=linux-$(LINUX_HEADERS_VERSION).tar.gz
	LINUX_HEADERS_CAT:=$(ZCAT)
	(Rem: There is no need for this change anymore, as the kernel souzrces of FT are used instead; see also Readme.md.)
