1. Needed changes in .config (and config. old), located in root folder of buildroot:
1.a due to "locale" failure while building uclibc, change BR2_TOOLCHAIN_BUILDROOT_LOCALE, BR2_ENABLE_LOCALES and BR2_EXTRA_GCC_CONFIG_OPTIONS to:
	# BR2_TOOLCHAIN_BUILDROOT_LOCALE is not set
	# BR2_ENABLE_LOCALES is not set
	BR2_EXTRA_GCC_CONFIG_OPTIONS="--disable-nls"
    	
1.b Download mirror of kernel is not available anymore, so change BR2_KERNEL_MIRROR:
	BR2_KERNEL_MIRROR="https://www.linux-mips.org/pub/linux/mips/kernel/v2.6"
 
1.c gcc in freshtomato uses ssp-lib, so set BR2_TOOLCHAIN_BUILDROOT_USE_SSP to yes:
	BR2_TOOLCHAIN_BUILDROOT_USE_SSP=y 

1.d no need to compile some uncessary packages for the toolchain, so change 
        BR2_PACKAGE_BUSYBOX_SHOW_OTHERS, BR2_PACKAGE_ZLIB, BR2_PACKAGE_LIBGCRYPT, BR2_PACKAGE_LIBGPG_ERROR and 
	BR2_PACKAGE_OPENSSL from "=y" to "is not set" und and comment them out.("#")

1.e as in original toolchain of FT the option "config_soft_float" is set to "no", check, if BR2_SOFT_FLOAT is also not set
      (BR2_SOFT_FLOAT is not set")

2. Changes in file packages/Makefile.in: 
    delete "unknown" out of target-triple, means 
   "REAL_GNU_TARGET_NAME=$(ARCH)-unknown-linux-$(LIBC)$(ABI)" has to be changed into 
   "REAL_GNU_TARGET_NAME=$(ARCH)-linux-$(LIBC)$(ABI)"

3. Changes in toolchain/uClibc/uClibc-0.9.30.config:
   Replace the content of config file of uClibc (uclibc-0.9.30.config) by the content of uClibc.config-file of the original FT toolchain. 
   Then change following paths in this modded uClibc-0.9.30.config: 
	KERNEL_HEADERS="./toolchain_build_mips/linux/include"	in 	KERNEL_HEADERS="/usr/src/linux/include"
   	DEVEL_PREFIX	in 	DEVEL_PREFIX="/usr/"
	RUNTIME_PREFIX	in	RUNTIME_PREFIX="/"
	SHARED_LIB_LOADER_PREFIX	in	SHARED_LIB_LOADER_PREFIX="/lib"

4. Changes in toolchain/gcc/gcc-uclibc-4.x.mk:
4.a gmp und mpfr can not be used by gcc-4.2.4 so to save time, comment out following lines (line 110-115 and 125):
	$(GCC_WITH_HOST_GMP), $(GCC_WITH_HOST_MPFR) 
	GCC_WITH_HOST_GMP = --with-gmp=$(HOST_DIR)/usr
	GCC_WITH_HOST_MPFR = --with-mpfr=$(HOST_DIR)/usr
	ifeq ($(BR2_TOOLCHAIN_BUILDROOT),y)
		HOST_SOURCE += host-gmp-source host-mpfr-source
	endif
	GCC_HOST_PREREQ = host-gmp host-mpfr
	...
	GCC_TARGET_PREREQ += mpfr gmp

4.b texinfo/gettext makes trouble during build process of gcc; unneeded documentation can be switched off by additional option of configure:
		MAKEINFO=missing
    (integrate in all of 3 building stages of gcc)

4.c Use all C- and C++-options of gcc of FT-toolchain (but without -fhonour-copts!, -> error:  "unknown option"); they have to be integrated as options in "make" command in all of the 3 stages of gcc (gcc-4.2.4-initial, gcc-4.2.4-intermediate und gcc-4.2.4-final): 
	CFLAGS_FOR_TARGET="-Os -std=gnu89 -fgnu89-inline -pipe -mips32 -mtune=mips32 -funit-at-a-time" \
	CXXFLAGS_FOR_TARGET="-Os -pipe -mips32 -mtune=mips32 -funit-at-a-time" 
 	
4.d gcc of original FT-toolchain uses tls, so add additional configure option to all of 3 building stages of gcc:
		--enable-tls

5. Changes in toolchain/uClibc/uclibc.mk:
   Take over C- und C++-flags of FT-toolchain; integrate them as "CPU-FLAGS"-options in nearly all "make" commands:
 	for make-targets "install_headers": 
	  CPU_CFLAGS="-Os -pipe -mips32 -mtune=mips32 -funit-at-a-time" 
	resp. for make-targets "all", "install_runtime", "install_dev", "hostutils", "install_runtime", "utils" and install_utils":
	  CPU_CFLAGS="-funsigned-char -fno-builtin -fno-asm --std=gnu99 -ffunction-sections -fdata-sections -Os -pipe -mips32 -mtune=mips32 -funit-at-a-time"
        
6. Changes in toolchain/kernel-headers/kernel-headers.mk (as the kernel sources are only available as .gz package):
	LINUX_HEADERS_SOURCE:=linux-$(LINUX_HEADERS_VERSION).tar.gz
	LINUX_HEADERS_CAT:=$(ZCAT)
