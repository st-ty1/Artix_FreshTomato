Will come soon, with binutils 2.23/2.25 and patches for kernel 2.6.22.19 and userland progs to build FreshTomato-mips. Currently running on an Asus RT-N66U, in router mode. All userland progs of AIOversion can be compiled; worst was kernel.
Nginx can be build without libatomics_ops (tested), because gcc 5.3 has its own libatomics.
