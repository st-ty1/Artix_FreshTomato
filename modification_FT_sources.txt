1. Add at end of file release/src/router/common.mak following lines (to inhibit error message, e.g. by iptables-1.6.x or by samba3, due to shared
   libraries needed by the FT-progs but already existing on host system as shared x64-libs)
	export PKG_CONFIG_DIR=
	export PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR=$(SRCBASE)
	export PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR=$(SRCBASE)

2. in file release/src/router/tor/configure.ac two of the search routines for systemd and libzstd has to be commented out (due to more aggressive search to them in
   newer versions of tor and that theses searches will errornously find the host-versions of systemd and libzstd and will lead to build breaks.)
	
3. in file release/src/router/miniupnpd/genconfig.sh following 3 lines has to be commented out (due to uuid.h/libuuid already exists on host system, 
   but cannot be uninstalled on host system)	
		"if grep uuid_generate /usr/include/uuid/uuid.h > /dev/null 2>&1 ; then
		 	 echo "#define LIB_UUID" >> ${CONFIGFILE}
		 fi"

4. Modifications needed in release/src/router/Makefile:
	- at target portmap/stamp-h1 change
			"cd portmap \
		 	 $(MAKE) -C portmap ... "
		into
			"cd portmap"

        - at target sd-idle delete following line:
		"cd sd-idle && \"

	- only arm: at target flac/stamp-h1 add following option to LDFLAGS: 
		"-L$(TOOLCHAIN)/lib"
		
	- only arm: at target libxml2/stamp-h1 add following option to $(CONFIGURE):
		"  --with-zlib="$(TOP)/zlib/staged/usr"  "
	
	- only mips: at target php/stamp-h1 change "CXX=$(ARCH)-g++" into "CXX=$(CROSS_COMPILE)g++" and
	         add to LIBS " -L$(TOP)/$(OPENSSLDIR)" and "-lcrypto -lssl"
	
	- only mips: add at end of target libcurl the following line:
	        "@rm -f libcurl/staged/usr/lib/libcurl.la"
        
	- add at end of target libnfsidmap-install the following line:
	        "@rm -f libnfsidmap/staged/usr/lib/libnfsidmap.la"
		
	- add these two additional -D arguments to cmake command getdns/build/Makefile-target:
 		  -DSTRPTIME_WORKS_EXITCODE="PLEASE_FILL_OUT-FAILED_TO_RUN" \
		  -DSTRPTIME_WORKS_EXITCODE__TRYRUN_OUTPUT="PLEASE_FILL_OUT-NOTFOUND" -Hforce \

	- only ARM: at target ipset/stamp-h1 insert at LDFLAGS 
			"-L$(TOP)/libmnl/staged/usr/lib -lmnl" 
		(only needed if ipset is installed in your host system; libtool links libmnl to ipset, but  
		the wrong search path is hardcoded in libmnl.la: /usr/lib instead of $(TOPDIR)/libmnl/staged/usr/lib/, 
		so libtool wants to link the libmnl of host system and causes error message)
	
	- colored output with ANSI escape sequences in bash shell is only possible with "printf" command but not with "echo"; 
	  If color support in terminal output is wanted, change 
	 	“echo "\033[41;1m““ into “printf "\033[41;1m““ (overall two different positions in Makefile)
		
5. a) only needed for freshtomato-mips/RT-AC-branch: modification of release/src-rt-6.x/linux/linux-2.6/scrpits/squashfs/mksquashfs.c:
		insert "#include <sys/sysmacros.h>" between line 37 and 38 (somwhere in the header list; exact position not important)
   b) only needed for freshtomato-mips/master-branch: mod. of release/src-rt/linux/linux-2.6/scripts/squashfs/mksquashfs.c:
		insert "#include <sys/sysmacros.h>" between line 37 and 38 (somwhere in the header list; exact position not important)
  (mod. needed as Artix uses newer glibc(2.30) than Debian 9 (glibc2.24); since glibc2.27 some functions have moved within the glibc header files.)

6. Delete file desdata.stamp in folder /release/src/router/nettle (as it crashes building process!)
