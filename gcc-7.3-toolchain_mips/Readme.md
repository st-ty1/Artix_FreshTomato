toolchain with gcc-7.3, binutils-2.28.1, uclibc 0.9.32.1 and kernel headers of FT-sources:
 
Only two additional patches needed (compared to gcc-5.3-toolchain). 

Of course, all patches of the gcc-5.3-toolchain_mips subfolder are still needed, too. 

Start with build_ft-mips-2016_02_RT-AC.sh script. (Paths in this script can be changed to your needs; script only available for RT-AC routers, yet)
