1. Modifications needed in release/src/router/Makefile:
	- at target php/stamp-h1 add to LIBS " -L$(TOP)/$(OPENSSLDIR)" and "-lcrypto -lssl"
	
	- add at end of target libcurl the following line:
	        "@rm -f libcurl/staged/usr/lib/libcurl.la"
        
	- add at end of target libnfsidmap-install the following line:
	        "@rm -f libnfsidmap/staged/usr/lib/libnfsidmap.la"
	
	- at end of taget libpng add the following line: 
		"@rm -f $(TOP)/libpng/staged/usr/lib/libpng.la
		 @rm -f $(TOP)/libpng/staged/usr/lib/libpng12.la"
		
2. In release/src/router/miniupnpd/configure following code has to be commented (due to existance of uuid.h/libuuid on host-OS, which can't be uninstalled):
    
    	if grep uuid_generate /usr/include/uuid/uuid.h > /dev/null 2>&1 ; then
    	echo "#define LIB_UUID" >> ${CONFIGFILE}
    	fi
    to
    	#if grep uuid_generate /usr/include/uuid/uuid.h > /dev/null 2>&1 ; then
    	#echo "#define LIB_UUID" >> ${CONFIGFILE}
    	#fi
   
3. Configure.in in release/src/router/apcupsd/autoconf has to be patched due to update to autoconf 2.70 on host-OS.

4. configure.ac of transmission has to be patched because of break by intltoolize.

5. alloca.m4 has to be patched due to newer versions of GNU-autotools (autoconf, automake,...) on host-OS.
