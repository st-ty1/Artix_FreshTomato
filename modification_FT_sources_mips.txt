1. Add following lines at end of file release/src/router/common.mak (to inhibit error message, e.g. by iptables-1.6.x or by samba3, due to shared
   libraries needed by the FT-progs but already existing on host system as shared x64-libs)
	export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=
	export PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR=$(SRCBASE)
	export PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR=$(SRCBASE)

2. in file release/src/router/tor/configure.ac two of the search routines for systemd and libzstd has to be commented out (due to more aggressive search to them in
   newer versions of tor and that theses searches will errornously find the host-versions of systemd and libzstd and will lead to build breaks.)
	
3. in file release/src/router/miniupnpd/genconfig.sh following 3 lines has to be commented out (due to uuid.h/libuuid already exists on host system, 
   but cannot be uninstalled on host system)	
		"if grep uuid_generate /usr/include/uuid/uuid.h > /dev/null 2>&1 ; then
		 	 echo "#define LIB_UUID" >> ${CONFIGFILE}
		 fi"

4. Modifications needed in release/src/router/Makefile:
	- at target php/stamp-h1 add to LIBS " -L$(TOP)/$(OPENSSLDIR)" and "-lcrypto -lssl"
	
	- add at end of target libcurl the following line:
	        "@rm -f libcurl/staged/usr/lib/libcurl.la"
        
	- add at end of target libnfsidmap-install the following line:
	        "@rm -f libnfsidmap/staged/usr/lib/libnfsidmap.la"
		
	- add these two additional -D arguments to cmake command getdns/build/Makefile-target:
 		  -DSTRPTIME_WORKS_EXITCODE="PLEASE_FILL_OUT-FAILED_TO_RUN" \
		  -DSTRPTIME_WORKS_EXITCODE__TRYRUN_OUTPUT="PLEASE_FILL_OUT-NOTFOUND" -Hforce \
		  
	- at target libevent/stamp-h1 insert following line in front of $(CONFIGURE)... :
		PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$(PKG_CONFIG_PATH):$(TOP)/openssl-1.1" \
		 
	- colored output with ANSI escape sequences in bash shell is only possible with "printf" command but not with "echo". 
	  If color support in terminal output is wanted, change 
	 	“echo "\033[41;1m““ into “printf "\033[41;1m““ (overall two different positions in Makefile)
		
5. Delete file desdata.stamp in folder /release/src/router/nettle (as it crashes building process!)

6. Due to change from gcc-9 to gcc-10 on Artix, some old source code in release/src/router/config and mksquashfs.c in release/src-rt/linux/linux
   -2.6/scripts/squashfs (resp. in release/src-rt-6.x/linux/linux-2.6/scripts/squashfs) has to be patched.
