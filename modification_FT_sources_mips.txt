1. Add following line at end of file release/src/router/common.mak (to inhibit error message of miniupnpd and samba3, due to shared
   libraries needed by the FT-progs but libs also existing on host system as shared x64-libs):
		export PKG_CONFIG_DIR=
		export PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR=$(SRCBASE)
		export PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR=$(SRCBASE)

2. in file release/src/router/tor/configure.ac the search routines for systemd has to be commented out (due to more aggressive search 
   for files of systemd, even on host; indeed Artix is a non-systemd OS, but still has a (dummy) libsystemd.so, this "partly existence" 
   of systemd on host will break configuring of tor and also the building process of FT.)
	
3. Modifications needed in release/src/router/Makefile:
	- at target php/stamp-h1 add to LIBS " -L$(TOP)/$(OPENSSLDIR)" and "-lcrypto -lssl"
	
	- add at end of target libcurl the following line:
	        "@rm -f libcurl/staged/usr/lib/libcurl.la"
        
	- add at end of target libnfsidmap-install the following line:
	        "@rm -f libnfsidmap/staged/usr/lib/libnfsidmap.la"
		
	- add these two additional -D arguments to cmake command in target getdns/build/Makefile:
 		  -DSTRPTIME_WORKS_EXITCODE="PLEASE_FILL_OUT-FAILED_TO_RUN" \
		  -DSTRPTIME_WORKS_EXITCODE__TRYRUN_OUTPUT="PLEASE_FILL_OUT-NOTFOUND" -Hforce \
		  
	- at target libevent/stamp-h1 insert following line in front of $(CONFIGURE)... :
		PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$(PKG_CONFIG_PATH):$(TOP)/openssl-1.1" \
		
	- at target tor/stamp-h1 add argument "-disable-zstd" to $(CONFIGURE)
		 
	- colored output with ANSI escape sequences in bash shell is only possible with "printf" command but not with "echo". 
	  If color support in terminal output is wanted, change 
	 	“echo "\033[41;1m““ into “printf "\033[41;1m““ (overall two different positions in Makefile)
		
4. Delete file desdata.stamp in folder /release/src/router/nettle (as it crashes building process!)

5. Due to change from gcc-9 to gcc-10 on Artix, some old source code in mksquashfs.c (located at release/src-rt/linux/linux
   -2.6/scripts/squashfs resp. at release/src-rt-6.x/linux/linux-2.6/scripts/squashfs) has to be patched.
